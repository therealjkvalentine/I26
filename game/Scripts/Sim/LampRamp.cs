/// default; I76_LAMP_RAMP=0|1 overrides it, I76_LAMP_RAMP_SCALE stretches the times for A/B). The original draws a lamp lit
/// or unlit from the frame its flag changes, and so does the 1997 look. A 1976 car's lamps are 12 V incandescent bulbs: a
/// tail or brake filament (a 21 W bulb) reaches full brightness in roughly a hundred to two hundred milliseconds, a 55 W
/// sealed-beam headlamp a little slower, and each dies away over roughly two to four hundred milliseconds with a visible
/// orange tail as the filament cools: the colour temperature drops before the light is gone, so the lamp goes red-shifted
/// and dimmer. Each lamp's drawn level is an exponential approach to its switch with a time constant for the rise and a longer
/// one for the fall; below <see cref="CoolBelow"/> of full the colour is pulled toward <see cref="Cool"/> (a white lamp's
/// last glimmer is orange; a red lens passes red whatever the filament's colour, so the brake and tail lamps only dim).
/// Drawn only: the simulation's lamp flags and the brake rule are untouched, and a frame's step depends on its delta alone.
