/// The modern look's muzzle light: the brief light a shot sets off at the muzzle, reaching the world in front of and beside the car
/// at night (the ground, the cliffs and slopes, the rocks, buildings and other cars), scaled by the weapon (a cannon reaches
/// further than a machine gun), and down to a trace in the sun. Two lights a gun: a small near omni light just ahead of the
/// muzzle, which is what the firing car itself takes (about half of what the light before the key gave it), and a far spot
/// light lifted above the barrel and aimed level along it, falling off slowly, so that flat ground, which a light at the muzzle's
/// height meets edge on, takes it out to the range and a cliff face square on to it more; its cone stops short of straight back,
/// where the car's own body stands between the flash and the ground behind it. The cabin's meshes take a third light of their
/// own (CombatView). [port] muzzle_reach in percent: 100 the table below; 0 the light as it was before the key (a 4 m pool, 0.8,
/// 1.2 m ahead of the muzzle, that lit little but the firing car: the near light at those figures, the far one dark); between and
/// above, each figure goes along the line from that one to the table's. I76_MUZZLE_REACH overrides the file for a run,
/// I76_MUZZLE_OFF=1 leaves the lights out (for measuring them). The original's (retail, at night only) is an omni light of range
/// 25 m on objects alone, never the ground (docs/deviations.md); the 1997 look draws none of this.
